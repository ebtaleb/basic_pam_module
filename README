This is a basic PAM module bundled with a basic application to demonstrate 2-step authentication.

It consists of 5 files:

* Makefile : to automate builing and cleaning
* pam_2step_auth.c : source file for the PAM module
* pam_ls.c : test application using the pam_2step_auth module
* pam_2step_auth.pamconf : configuration file for pam_ls
* sendsms : script used to send One Time Password via SMS

It is assumed that you have administrating priliveges and that make, openssl and PAM are installed in your system.
To setup the module and build the application: type "make".
To remove temporary files and the module: type "make clean".
